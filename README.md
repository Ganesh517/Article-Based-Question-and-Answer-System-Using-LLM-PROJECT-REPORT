about a given article. The system should utilize large language models (LLMs) to effectively 
process and understand the context of both the article and the question, enabling it to generate 
2
comprehensive and relevant answers. The system should be able to handle a variety of question 
types, including open-ended, challenging, and strange questions. Additionally, the system 
should provide evidence from the article to support its answers, enhancing the transparency and 
credibility of its responses
